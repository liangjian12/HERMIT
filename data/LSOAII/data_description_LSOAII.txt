This data is from the Second Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA II), see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/lsoa/lsoa2.htm. 

LSOA II is a collaborative study by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the National Institute of Aging conducted from 1994-2000. 
A national representative sample of 9447 subjects 70 years of age and over were selected and interviewed. Three separated interviews were conducted 
during the periods of 1994-1996, 1997-1998, and 1999-2000, respectively. The interviews are referred to as WAVE 1, WAVE 2, and WAVE 3 interviews, 
respectively. Each wave of interview included multiple modules covering wide range of assessments. We use data WAVE 2 and WAVE 3, which includes a 
total of 4299 sample subjects and 44 targets, and 188 features are extracted from WAVE 2 interview.

Among the targets, specifically, three self-rated health measures, including overall health status, memory status and depression status, can be 
regarded as continuous outcomes; there are 41 binary outcomes, which fall into several categories: 7 measures on fundamental daily activity, 
13 on extended daily activity, 5 on social involvement, 8 on medical condition, 4 on cognitive ability, and 4 on sensation condition.

The features include records of demographics, family structure, daily personal care, medical history, social activity, health opinion, behavior, 
nutrition, health insurance and income and assets, the majority of which are binary measurements.

Both targets and features have missing values due to non-response and questionnaire filtering. The average missing value rates in targets and 
features are 13.7% and 20.2%, respectively. For the missing values in features, we adopt the following procedure for pre-processing. For continuous 
features, the missing values are imputed with sample mean. For binary features, a better approach is to treat missing as a third category as it may 
also carry important information; as such, two dummy variables are created from each binary feature with missing values (the third one is not necessary.) 
This results in totally d=293 features.

We randomly select 30% of the samples for training, 30% for validation and the rest for testing.
