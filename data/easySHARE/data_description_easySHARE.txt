This data is a simplified data set from the Survey of Heath, Aging, and Retirement
in Europe (SHARE), see http://www.share-project.org/data-access-documentation.html. 
SHARE includes multidisciplinary and cross-national panel databases
on health, socio-economic status, and social and family networks of more than 85,000
individuals from 20 European countries aged 50 or over. Four waves of interviews were
conducted during 2004 - 2011, and are referred to as WAVE 1 to WAVE 4 interviews. We 
use WAVE 1 and WAVE 2, which includes 20,449 sample persons and 15 targets (among which 
11 are binary, and 4 are continuous), and totally 75 features are constructed from WAVE 1 interview.

The features cover a wide range of assessments, including demographics, household composition, 
social support and network, physical health, mental health, behavior risk, healthcare, occupation 
and income. Detailed description features are not listed in this paper.

Both targets and features have missing values due to non-response and questionnaire filtering. 
The average missing value rates in targets and features are 6.9% and 5.1%, respectively. The same 
pre-processing procedure as that for LSOA II Data has been adopted and results in totally d=118 features.

We randomly select 10% of the samples for training, 10% for validation and the rest for testing.



Variables in data_processed_easySHARE.mat:

train_X: X for training
train_Y: Y for training
valid_X: X for validation
valid_Y: Y for validation
test_X:  X for testing
test_Y:  Y for testing

train_Omega: observed entries of training targets
valid_Omega: observed entries of validation targets
test_Omega:  observed entries of testing targets

task_type: type of each task, e.g., 1: Gaussian task, 2: Bernoulli task, 3: Poisson task
task_num_each_type: number of tasks for each type, e.g., [4,11,0] means 4 Gaussian tasks, 11 Bernoulli tasks, 0 Poisson tasks.


Variables in feature_description_easySHARE.mat
feature_description: description of 118 features. The first feature is bias and named 'NULL'. 'IS MISSING' means that the feature with the name afterwards is missing.

Variables in task_description_easySHARE.mat
task_description: description of 15 tasks.
